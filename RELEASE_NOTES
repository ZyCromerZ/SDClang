This is the release of Snapdragon LLVM ARM C/C++ compiler toolchain version
10.0. This is a cross toolchain built to run on x86 64-bit Ubuntu Linux
(versions 14.04 and later) and Windows platform (Windows 7 64-bit and later).
The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler will generate code for ARM and X86 targets 
and will not generate code for any of the other targets supported by the
llvm.org compiler.

Version 10.0 of the Snapdragon LLVM ARM toolchain includes all changes in the
llvm.org 9.0 mainline as of 9/27/19. The Snapdragon LLVM ARM toolchain 10.0 
release includes proprietary features and optimizations that are not available
in the llvm.org 9.0 mainline.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler uses the integrated assembler for assembling
and includes a full featured proprietary linker (QC Linker) for linking.

The following link contains all the new features in the llvm.org 9.0 release.
http://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM 10.0 toolchain contains all the above features, and 
additionally contains the following key features compared to the Snapdragon
LLVM ARM 8.0 toolchain:

1. Auto-Vectorization performance improvements for image processing
2. Code size improvements for Baremetal images
3. X86 code generation
4. Performance tuning of optimizations, such as the unroller for Baremetal 
   workloads
5. Code size tuning for Android-Go images
6. Support for structured exception handling (SEH) for ARM 64-bit targets
